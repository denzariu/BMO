# BMO
## Friendliest voice assistant
BMO is a friendly voice assistant with multiple functionalities: informative (time &amp; date, weather condition, descriptions of concepts, translations, writing/playing notes, math, etc.) &amp; recreational (playing content from Youtube, fetching content from Reddit, video games, sound visualizer etc.), interactions that emphasize on user's experience, with minimal preconfiguration.

## Disclaimer
This project was not made with the intention of being public, it will definitely be incompatible with your RPi because most paths are not relative. I will not try to rework the project into a repo-friendly package, as it is intended to only be a showcase.

## Temporary Description
This project came as a response to the need of people to feel close to other members of their community, a need that is amplified by the choice of spending free time using various technologies which are created around an utilitarian philosophy. This project changes the approach from common technological means that give the feeling of dispassionate interaction to offering a friendly, more endearing, alternative experience. However, the realized project does not aim to replace the social needs of an individual, but only to reimagine the concepts of interaction with the user, with emphasis on his experience.
